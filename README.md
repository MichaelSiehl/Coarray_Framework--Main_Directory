# Coarray Wrapper Framework: Main_Directory
Fortran Coarray Wrapper Framework: Overwiew with Links to the Distinct Parts

# Welcome
This GitHub repository serves as the main directory and overview for our Fortran Coarray Wrapper Framework (using Fortran 2008 and beyond). Here you will find an overview of the distinct parts of the framework with links to those GitHub repositories that contain the actual implementation of the features (together with some simple test cases).<br />
<br />
Everything is still under construction and it will take some time to complete the framework for use in production. Phase 1, the low-level part of the framework, will contain few user-defined (customized) synchronization primitives, functionality to check and restore (user-defined) segment ordering among coarray images, and distinct coarray wrappers to separate direct access to coarrays from the implementation of the (parallel) logic codes. The time frame for finishing a first version of this part of the framework is currently expected in mid 2018.<br />
